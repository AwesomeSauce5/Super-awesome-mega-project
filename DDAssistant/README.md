##JFreeChart
To get the chart working you will need to download JFreeChart from http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/index.html.

JCommons is already included with JFreeChart. In Eclipse right click the project and select preferences->
Java Build Path->Libraries->Add External JARs and link Eclipse to jcommon-1.0.23.jar and jfreechart-1.0.19.jar.
They should appear as referenced libraries in package explorer.
